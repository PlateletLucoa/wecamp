# wecamp
Source code for https://wecamp.herokuapp.com/

A camping website written with a pure JS stack (Mongo, Express, Node).

node_modules folder couldn't be transferred because of the amount of files in it. You should be able to run this application locally by forking this, run 'npm install' and then use 'serve' or similar npm packages although you might need to provide a MongoDB database on your own if you opt for this option.
